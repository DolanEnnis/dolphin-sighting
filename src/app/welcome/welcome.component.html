        Shannon Pilots are proud to provide this public service. Our work is
        devoted to safety, security and environmental protection, thus enhancing
        port efficiency. This is why we feel it important to assist the Irish
        Whale and Dolphin Group to hopefully get a better understanding of
        movement and habits of the resident bottlenose dolphins on the Shannon
        Estuary. We as maritime pilots are the only group who transit the estuary
        throughout the year on a daily basis and are therefore in a unique
        position to be able to gather data that was not previously explored.

        The main species we have in the estuary is the Bottlenose Dolphin. They
        are probably the best known species of dolphin due to their coastal
        habitats, widespread distribution, and many appearances on television.
        Bottlenose dolphins are usually seen in small groups and are rarely seen
        alone. They are quite active at the surface of the water. When traveling
        slowly, about one-quarter to one-third of the body appears above the
        water. When traveling at speed they often jump clear out of the water.

    <h2>Observed Behaviors</h2>
    <p>We have identified the following common behaviors (feel free to add your own observations in reports):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Foraging</strong> - Indications of searching for prey, prey capture or
        feeding behaviors (surface rushing)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Play</strong> - Interactions with objects other than dolphins which serve no
        obvious purpose
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rest</strong> - Slow, steady activity in absence of other identifiable
        activities, often with long dive bouts (1 to 5 min)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Travel</strong> - Regular directional movement, including zig-zag and
        meandering movement
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>With boat</strong> - All cases during which dolphins interact with a boat,
        including bow- and wake-riding
      </li>
    </ul>
